# weatherpy

I created a Python script that pulled data for 500+ cities around the world using the OpenWeatherMap API.

I built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
